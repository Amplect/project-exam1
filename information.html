        <h2>space programs around the world</h2>
        <div class="ptext">
            <p>Space is very big, bigger than we know for sure, and we want to explore.</p>
            <p>Space programs are therefore all over the world, not just the big ones you know about, like NASA, SpaceX and RFSA. These are only a few of them, and these are government space agencies, along with three more; ESA, ISRO and CNSA. These six have full launch capability, which means they can launch and recover satellites, operate space probes and deploy cryogenic rocket engines.</p>

            <h3>cnsa</h3>
            <p>China National Space Administration is the fastest-rising space agency in the world at the moment. During the last two decades they have had more technologically advanced and ambitious missions.</p>
            <div class="infotext">
                <p>The CNSA hopes to deploy a modular space station, conduct crewed missions to the moon, robotic missions to Mars and collaborate with other agencies in highly ambitious projects that can increase their status and knowledge to put them alongside the most well-known and advanced programs like NASA and Roscosmos.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="infocard">
            <h3>esa</h3>
            <p>The European Space Agency was formed in 1975, and was the result of combining the space programs from several European countries(Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.K.).</p>
            <div class="infotext">
                <p>Their purpose is “to provide for and to promote for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among European States in space research and technology, and their space applications, with a view to this being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems”.</p>
                <p>This agency reaches all the way back to post-WWII Europe, but has since then risen to become a major power in space.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="infocard">
            <h3>isro</h3>
            <p>Like the CNSA, the Indian Space Research Organization has undergone a rapid expansion in recent decades as a result of India’s growing economic and power. Their foray into space, however, can be traced back even further than the last few decades.</p>
            <div class="infotext">
                <p>They plan to become the fourth power to send actual astronauts into space, explore celestial bodies with orbiters, rovers and landers, and eventually have humans do the same.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="infocard">
            <h3>nasa</h3>
            <p>Nationality Aeronautics and Space Administration’s exploit are very well-documented. They have done several things over our history, including sending astronauts into space as early as the 1950’s and 1960’s, sending the first humans to the moon and has explored both the inner and outer solar system. None of the other space programs can match their historic legacy.</p>
            <div class="infotext">
                <p>The up and coming agencies can, however, threaten their leadership in the field. To ensure that they stay on top, NASA plans to conduct renewed crewed missions to the moon, and the first crewed missions to Mars.</p>

            <h3>rfsa/roscosmos</h3>
            <p>The Soviet Space Program was NASA’s competitor in the “Space Race”, but the budget changes and political issues caused them to cede their leadership to NASA in the beginning of the 1990’s.</p>
            <div class="infotext">
                <p>The Russian space program had a downturn after the cold war and the fall of communism, and they also had some economic issues, so they couldn’t keep everything up. After 15 years, however, the State corporation for Space Activities took over, and they start to get back to their former glory.</p>
                <p>The spirit of competition between NASA and Roscosmos still exists today, and its defined through the cooperation with the International Space Station.</p>

            <h3>jaxa</h3>
            <p>The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is the result of a merger between three previously independent organizations working with space and technology that happened on October 1st, 2003.</p>
            <div class="infotext">
                <p>They are responsible for research, technology development and launch of satellites into orbit and is involved in many more advanced missions like asteroid exploration and possible human exploration of the moon.</p>
                <p>Their slogan is “Explore to realize”.</p>
